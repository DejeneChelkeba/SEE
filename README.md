Welcome to the Fun Calculator! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with a playful twist. It's perfect for beginners learning Python or anyone who wants a cheerful calculation experience.

✨ Features
Basic arithmetic operations:

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

➗ Division

Decimal support: Handles both integers and floating-point numbers

Playful interface: Fun emojis and comments throughout the code

Immediate results: Displays all four operations at once

🚀 How to Run
Ensure you have Python 3 installed

Run the script:

bash
python fun_calculator.py
Follow the prompts to enter two numbers

See the results instantly!

⚠️ Important Notes
Division by zero: The program will crash if you enter 0 as the second number

Input validation: Only accepts numeric inputs (program will crash with non-numeric input)

Floating-point precision: Results may show floating-point rounding artifacts

📝 Sample Output
text
Enter the first number: 8.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 10.5
Difference: 6.5
Product: 17.0
Quotient: 4.25
🔧 Potential Improvements
Add error handling for:

Division by zero

Non-numeric inputs

Include more operations:

Modulus (%)

Exponentiation (**)

Floor division (//)

Implement looping for multiple calculations

Add rounding options for decimal results

💻 Code Structure
python
# Get user inputs
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform calculations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2  # Potential crash if num2 == 0

# Display results
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
